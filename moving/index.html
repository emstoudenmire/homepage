<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Stainless Fridge by Whirlpool&mdash; <span style="color:green">$500</span><br/>
<p>
Excellent condition Whirlpool fridge with stainless exterior and french door design. I am pricing it to sell because I am about to move cross-country. I bought it last year for $1000 and have enjoyed using it. Has an ice maker, large freezer with two level drawers, a deli drawer, and adjustable glass shelves.

Tan Sofa &mdash; <span style="color:green">$175</span><br/>
<p>
This sofa is very deep and comfortable. It is in excellent condition
and has been only very lightly used. I originally
got it from Rooms to Go for about $400+tax. Includes the throw pillows
shown in the photos.

Ikea Bed (Queen size)&mdash; <span style="color:green">$300</span><br/>
<p>
Stately bed by Ikea, in perfect condition. It's barely been used
as I use it for guests and have only had company four times since
I bought it. (Price for this item new was $350 + tax.) It uses a queen size
mattress (the one for sale below fits it perfectly).

Ikea Nightstand&mdash; <span style="color:green">$125</span><br/>
<p>
Black nightstand with a very polished look. It feels very solid too.
It's in perfect condition&mdash;I just assembled it a couple of months ago
for my guest room and have only had two guests since. (Price for
this item new was $150 + tax, plus I did all of the hard work of assembling it for you!)

Ikea Queen Mattress&mdash; <span style="color:green">$350</span><br/>
<p>
Very lightly used, high-end queen sized mattress from IKEA
in perfect condition.
It's my guest room mattress and has only been used 4 times.
This is a quality spring mattress from IKEA with a pillow top.
Has a medium-firm feel and is great for your back. I originally
paid $400 + tax for it last fall 2016.

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Bike Roof Rack&mdash; <span style="color:green">$150</span><br/>
<p>
Unopened, top of the line bike rack by Yakima. I was intending to
use it but now I'm selling my car so won't be able to. I haven't 
even opened the box. I paid $190+tax for this rack originally. 
These last a really long time and make it easy to mount your bike 
since you don't even have to take the front wheel off. Mounts on 
both round and oval shaped roof racks.

Desk Chair&mdash; <span style="color:green">$40</span> (Or best offer)<br/>
<p>
Desk chair with great arm and back support. I originally bought it for $100 but am selling it 
because there are a limited number of things I can bring with me on my move.
