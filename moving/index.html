<p>
My name is Miles and I am moving to New York City on August 25th.
I am trying to sell many of my larger items to
fit into a tiny NYC apartment.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
A good way to reach me is email: miles.stoudenmire@gmail.com <br/>
Or text me at: 404-915-4041
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Here are the things I am selling:
</p>
<br/>

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Tan Sofa &mdash; <span style="color:green">$150</span><br/>
<p>
This sofa is very deep and comfortable. It is in great condition with no
wear or tear I can see, and has been only very lightly used. I originally
got it from Rooms to Go. Includes throw pillows.

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Bike Roof Rack&mdash; <span style="color:green">$160</span><br/>
<p>
Unopened, top of the line bike rack by Yakima. I was intending to
use it but now I'm selling my car so won't be able to. I haven't 
even opened the box. These retail for $190 (plus tax), last a really
long time, and make it easy to mount your bike since you don't even
have to take the front wheel off. Mounts on both round and oval
shaped roof racks.

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Ikea Bed&mdash; <span style="color:green">$250</span><br/>
<p>
Stately bed by Ikea, in "like new" condition. It's barely been used
as I use it for guests and have only had company four times since
I bought it. (Price for this item new was $350.)

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Ikea Nightstand&mdash; <span style="color:green">$100</span><br/>
<p>
Black nightstand with a very polished look. It feels very solid too.
It's essentially new, as I just assembled it a couple of months ago
for my guest room and have only had two guests since. (Price for
this item new was $150.)

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Ikea Mattress&mdash; <span style="color:green">$300</span><br/>
<p>
Very lightly used, high-end mattress from IKEA.
It's my guest room mattress and has only been used about 4 times.
This is a quality spring mattress from IKEA with a pillow top.
Has a medium-firm feel and is great for your back.

<div class="contributor" style="border:solid black 1px; padding: 10px;">
Desk Chair&mdash; <span style="color:green">$40</span> (Or best offer)<br/>
<p>
Desk chair with great arm and back support. I have gotten a lot of work
done in this thing. I originally bought it for $100 but am selling it 
because I am limited in the number of things I can move.
